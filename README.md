## Gaussian filtering image enhancement using standard thread library
This is a C++ implementation of spatial-domain image enhancement using Gaussian filtering, with multithreading via the standard thread library. Multithreading is used to reduce the execution time of the image convolution by parallelizing the computation across multiple threads.
